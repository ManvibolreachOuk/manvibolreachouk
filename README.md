- I am currently a second-year software engineering technology major who hopes to break into technology companies. I solve problems in creative ways. This year, I am not just obtaining my knowledge from my school. However, I improve my skills by building new software projects in different languages. And I also participate in volunteer jobs for getting real experience besides tons of projects in school and GitHub. Please consider the following highlights of my key accomplishments:
```bash
- Working with technology team members for a church technology, which has been a good relationship between ministries and volunteers and has provided people in a team to learn new software together. 
- Developing a new church application for aiming 1000 users weekly to log in and use, and providing the users more security to donate money to the application.
- Programming in ASP.NET and C#.NET in school starts from easy to hard rage exercises and projects.
- Doing Database projects with MySQL and MongoDB in the school curriculum with a maximum of 4 members in a team to create a new product with Agile, and drawing diagrams for creating algorithms of Database.
- Building three software products from scratch that addresses the issues of world technology by implementing a Software Requirement Specification document (SRS) and Software Design/Architecture Document (SDD) that can strengthen security using the Agile model.
